### 📦 Installing Dependencies

#### 1️⃣ Method 1: uv (**Recommended** ✅)

- Use [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management. It handles dependencies, virtual environments, and locking versions more efficiently.
- To install exact dependency versions specified in [**uv.lock**](./uv.lock) for consistent environments **without** installing the current project as a package:

  ```bash
  uv sync --no-install-project
  ```

#### 2️⃣ Method 2: pip

- Install all dependencies listed in [**requirements.txt**](./requirements.txt) using [**pip**](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/):

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

> [!CAUTION]
> **pip** does not lock dependency versions as strictly as `uv`. You may encounter version conflicts or reproducibility issues. Only use this method if you know what you are doing.

### 🛠️ Usage Instructions

1. Open the root folder in [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (`Ctrl/Cmd + K` then `Ctrl/Cmd + O`).
1. Open `.ipynb` files using the [**Jupyter extension**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) integrated within **VS Code**.
1. Allow **VS Code** to install any recommended dependencies for working with Jupyter Notebooks.
1. Select the correct Python kernel and virtual environment in which the dependencies were installed.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Stick with the **exact dependency versions** specified in [**uv.lock**](./uv.lock) or [**requirements.txt**](./requirements.txt). The repository has been **tested** with these versions to ensure **compatibility** and **stability**.
> - This repository is **actively maintained**, and dependencies are **updated regularly** to the latest **stable** versions.
> - The **table of contents** embedded within **notebooks (`.ipynb` files)** may not function correctly on **GitHub**.
> - For an improved experience, open the notebooks **locally** or view them via [**nbviewer**](https://nbviewer.org/github/mr-pylin/video-processing-workshop), rather than directly on **GitHub**.
